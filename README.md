**Day 14**

On clicking the icon the nav bar expands / shrinks.
- On expand, the icon rotates into a 'X', the opacity of the nav titles slowly appears using transition on opacity.
- On shrink, the icon rotates back into a '=', nav title disappears instantly (no transition).

The number of followers / subscribers is animated and increased.
- Use Javascript to increment and setTimeout function to slow the increment down for the effect.
